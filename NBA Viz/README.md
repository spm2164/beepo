The two csv's I worked with are included, but they are both sources from basketball-reference.com. My basic methodology was to use an advanced stat to show which player contracts were balanced vs the player's contribution to their team. I went with VORP because I felt this stat best captured the concept of "player contribution to team". I tried PER, but in the end, felt that it more represented individual (particularly offensive) prowess. VORP has problems too, but whatevs.

To help mitigate some of the problems with VORP, I decided to size my data points by Win Share. A player with a large Win Share is more valuable to their team, even if their VORP says they kind of stink, relative to the league. A hardworking, average player is still worth something, after all.

The next issue was to figure out how to highlight the data. Initially, I just ran top 20 in salary vs top 20 in VORP and set alpha to .5 to show the overlapping regions. That was kind of confusing and arbitrary, however. Instead, I went with top 10% in both, and then in addition top 1%, with alpha set to .3 roundabouts. I really should have done something more like a gradient but I don't have any idea how to do that currently. This wound up being a kind of hacky way to represent "best" and "worst". For player labels, I did a personal selection of players I consider interesting. The chart legend was generated 100% in illustrator.
