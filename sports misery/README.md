This is a lipstick-on-a-pig attempt to salvage some of the work I did on the city misery index, which wound up being much larger than anticipated. The heuristic is wrong and not what I want, the chart is MLB teams instead of sports cities, some other things, etc. But this chart popped out during a testing phase and actually tells a pretty surprising story anyway, so I ran with it.

I would have sworn that the Cubs, who constantly complain about not winning the World Series for over 100 years, would be the most miserable. Turns out, the Phillies, who have won the Series recently, have been way worse for way longer. The fact that Yankees fans are super spoiled is not surprising at all, the funny thing is that they were actually pretty crappy at first. Then, they got Babe Ruth and were instantly the best team forever.

I stole the logos and tried to annotate. My heuristic for deciding fan "misery" is based on where the team falls each year relative to the rest of the league. Teams at the bottom had a +1 miserable year. Teams at the top had a -1 miserable (or, positive) year. Towards the middle, I add or subtract partial points for pretty crappy or pretty ok seasons.
